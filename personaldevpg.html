		<p><font color="#424530">Three of my strengths includes Creativity, Flexibility, and Curiosity. Being a 
		creative person allows me to be an original person and enables me to have fresh perspectives and even 
		adapt to change better, which then makes me a flexible individual. I am flexible in that I am versatile 
		and open to new ideas and processes. Being curious makes me willing to learn and improve and constantly 
		seek knowledge and new ideas. In the last three to five years I have indeed made progress in developing 
		myself. I always try to reflect on situations and my actions and improve on the limitations that I discover. 
		I try to unlearn thoughts and biases that are non&#45;beneficial and&#47;or illogical, and try to practice more 
		critical thinking. I have been making changes down to the smallest of details.<p>

		<p><font color="#424530">The book <q>Twelve Pillars</q> written by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener 
		provides some important concepts that individuals use to improve themselves and their life. Reading 
		the book gave me ideas and a better understanding of principles I could apply to improve it and myself. 
		Those principles include the following&#58;</font></p>
		<ul type="circle">
					<li> <font color="#424530">Set goals to improve yourself through the <b>process</b> of achieving them</font> </li>
					<li> <font color="#424530">Use your time wisely and make the best out of each day</font> </li>
					<li> <font color="#424530">Disassociate or limit association with negative people and associate more with positive and successful people</font> </li>
					<li> <font color="#424530">Do more self&#45;learning, reflection and observation to grow and improve constantly</font> </li>
					<li> <font color="#424530">Improve your talent and virtues to grow your influence</font> </li>
					<li> <font color="#424530">Money is not necessarily more importante that personal development&#59; becoming a better person can improve your value which can then improve your income</font> </li>
		</ul>
		<p><font color="#424530">I can apply these core principles to my life by working smart, overcoming my 
		shortcomings, and unlearning by learning something new from everyone and every situation. As Brian Tracy 
		said, <q><i>Dedicate yourself to continuous personal improvement, you are your most precious resource.</i></q></font></p>
